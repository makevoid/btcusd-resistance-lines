# Forex-algotrading
This is the code for the Forex algotrading platform I am building on http://jon.io.
Go there and read the posts!

# Installation


Now let's create a virtualevn in order to install any dependancies:

> virtualenv /tmp/falgo

Let's activate the env
> source /tmp/falgo/bin/activate

Switch to the directory
> cd falgo

Install dependencies
> pip install -r requirements.txt

Start it up!
> python runner.py


# Running Machine Learning
First of all, download some data to play around or unzip and use the dataset in data/sample.csv.zip. This contains data for EURUSD for 2014 and a couple of months for 2015.

Then run the ml.py
> python ml.py data/sample.csv

When the algorithm completes, start a python webserver

> python3 -m http.server 8000

and open your browser to http://0.0.0.0:8000/chart.html
